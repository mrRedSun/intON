# intON
"IntON" is an interpreted programming language that I made for practicing my programming skills. It uses LR parsing algorithm.
Now with graphical interface!

# Basic syntax and supported operations
IntON uses C-like syntax. Parer ignores whitespace and does not support comments.

# Supported Operations
IntON supports:
- Variable declaration: **var \<id\> = \<value\>;** (value can be either number, true, false or math expression)
- Variable reassignment: **<\id\> = \<value\>**;
- Print statement: **print \<value\>;**
- If statement: **if (\<logic expression\>) { \<any code\> }** (logic expression can be either true, false or some comparison expression)
- While statement: **while (\<logic expression\>) { \<any code\> }**
